OpenStreetMap-NG is an unofficial Python fork of [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org). It's on a mission to push the boundaries of OpenStreetMap and provide a better experience for all users. It's simply the Next Generation of OpenStreetMap.

## üì¢ Development Updates

I actively post weekly/bi-weekly updates on the development of OpenStreetMap-NG on my [OpenStreetMap diary](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/NorthCrab/diary). You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/NorthCrab/diary/rss) to stay up-to-date.

## üë∑ Contributing

To get started contributing, see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Zaczero/openstreetmap-ng/wiki/Contributing:-Getting-Started) on the GitHub wiki. This wiki is the primary source of information for contributors. We support Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL2) operating systems.

You can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GM89hdjSCB) or [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#openstreetmap-ng:matrix.org) to receive personalized support and discuss development topics ‚Äî both platforms are bridged, so you'll see the same messages in either one. This is our primary internal communication channel. It's free to join and we're always happy to help you get started!

## ‚ú® The Vision

- **Simple to contribute**: OpenStreetMap-NG requires just basic Python knowledge to contribute. There are no complex abstractions or frameworks to learn. We use Nix to provide stress-free and streamlined developer experience on all platforms.

- **Super efficient**: OpenStreetMap-NG uses modern programming techniques to provide high performance and low latency. Most of the codebase is compiled to C language with Cython's [Pure Python Mode](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html).

- **Privacy first**: OpenStreetMap-NG is designed with privacy first approach. We give users the control over their data and privacy. The new builtin proxy for third-party requests additionally protects users identity.

- **Innovation**: OpenStreetMap-NG is a playground for new ideas and features. It's a place where the community can experiment with new features and technologies. We are not afraid of change!

## üî¢ KISS Principle

OpenStreetMap-NG follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). We believe that simplicity is the key to success and that less is more. We avoid complex abstractions and frameworks. We use straightforward and easy to understand Python code.

## üåç Community Driven

OpenStreetMap-NG is an open community-driven project. The best ideas come from people just like you! We believe the community is the heart of OpenStreetMap and that everyone should have an equal say.

This project is currently funded through community donations. We are not sponsored nor endorsed by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. We are ordinary mappers who want to make a difference.

## üìö Learn More

More feature details can be found in the project [announcement](https://github.com/Zaczero/openstreetmap-ng/blob/main/ANNOUNCEMENT.md). This information is not strictly up-to-date, but it provides a broader view of the project. More recent updates can be found on my [OpenStreetMap diary](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/NorthCrab/diary) but they are lesser in quantity.

## üõ£Ô∏è TODOs: Public Release

The following list outlines the key features and components that need to be completed before the first public release of OpenStreetMap-NG. This represents our roadmap to achieving 99% feature parity with the current OpenStreetMap website (Ruby).

**Release ETA**: end of 2024

- ‚¨õ Authorization with third-party providers
- [20%] Email notifications templates
- ‚¨õ Messages
- ‚¨õ Reporting of users
- ‚¨õ User diaries
- [30%] Website responsiveness (mobile)
