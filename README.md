Welcome to OpenStreetMap-NG, an innovative unofficial Python fork of [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org). Our mission is to revolutionize the map and provide a better experience for all users. It is simply the Next Generation of OpenStreetMap.

We will provide a demo website **at the end of 2024**. We are working hard on the final core features ‚Äî stay tuned!

üõà This initiative is not affiliated with the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

## üéØ Main Goals

### **New Features**

Implement long-awaited features and bring OpenStreetMap into the modern era. With a strong focus on innovation, we are committed to delivering a truly next-gen experience for users and programmers.

### **Performance**

Create a performant and responsive user and API experience. Leveraging modern technologies and CPython native modules, featuring a blazing-fast V2 map engine and optimized system architecture.

### **Privacy**

Enhance user privacy through built-in data protection mechanisms and secure defaults for all third-party integrations. We respect users' data and privacy choices.

### **Accessibility**

Make OpenStreetMap more accessible to everyone ‚Äî including mobile and impaired users. Using the latest browser standards and newly designed interfaces, we make the map a more enjoyable and welcoming place.

### **Openness**

Lower barriers to entry and empower the developer community. Following Keep-It-Simple principles, OpenStreetMap-NG is designed in a simple and hackable way, making contributing easy and fun.
