    description: |-
      Here you can manage all your OAuth 2.0 applications.
      These applications can integrate external services, access specific data, or automate tasks.
      Review the list below to update settings, manage permissions, or delete any application you no longer need.
    my_tokens_hint: |-
      Consider using access tokens when working on personal projects.
    you_have_not_created_any_applications_yet: You haven't created any applications yet.
    create_new_application: Create new application
  my_tokens:
    title: My tokens
    description: |-
      Personal access tokens provide a simple way to authenticate API requests.
      They're ideal for personal projects and when you don't need full OAuth authorization flow.
      Remember, these tokens provide access to your account, so keep them secure and private.
    how_to_use:
      title: Using your tokens
      description: |-
        Once you've created a token and generated its secret, you can use it to authenticate API requests.
        Include the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer authentication scheme.
        Remember to keep your tokens secure. They provide access to your account, so treat them like passwords.
      example_http_request: Example HTTP request
      example_curl_command: Example cURL command

  redirect_uris: Redirect URIs
  redirect_uris_description: |-
