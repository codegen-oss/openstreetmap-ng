# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows a rolling release model.
We only address security issues affecting the latest git commit of the [main branch](https://github.com/openstreetmap-ng/openstreetmap-ng/tree/main).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take a security-first approach.
If you suspect you've found a security issue in the project, please report it responsibly.
Your disclosure helps protect the OpenStreetMap community. Thank you!

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unsure whether an issue has security implications, it's safest to assume it has and report it.

To report a vulnerability, you can either use GitHub's builtin private vulnerability reporting feature or contact the maintainers directly.
